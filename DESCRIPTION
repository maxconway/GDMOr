Package: metabex
Title: Metabolic Model Explorer
Description: 
This package is for Cytoscape-based analysis of populations of metabolic models, and their properties.
The key datatype is a `data.frame`, with some columns prefixed with `genotype.` and some with `phenotype.`
Various graphs can be plotted to identify genes or reactions with unusual properties, and, once these properties are found, a suitable sybil model can be displayed in cytoscape and subsets of the metabolic network visualized.
