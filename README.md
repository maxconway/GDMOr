GDMOr
=====
This package is intended to provide tools for multi-objective metabolic engineering.
The main components are as follows:
- `GDMO` provides a generic, pure R multi-objective optimization framework, based on NSGA-II.
- `heatmapify`, `outlyingGenes`, `ShowFluxes` and `interactive_scatterplot` are functions to analyse and understand the results of multi-objective optimization. Several of these use the Cytoscape network visualization package.
